# Mots Couture API (NodeJS)

A simple API to store and return words for my Mots Couture word utility app. It is just word-focused CRUD for right now, but will eventually include user signup, login & auth for additional functionality - forums, games, etc.

The front-end app is ReactJS, mobile-focused, primarily local storage, with an option to share with or include from words from the community of users.

[Front-End App: motscouture.com](https://www.motscouture)

NodeJS, TypeScript, ExpressJS, SQLite
